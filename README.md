## Installation Guide

Firstly, ensure you have a Rocket.Chat Server running either locally or you have the URL of a remote running server.

1. Clone the repository to your local system:
    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/apps.ai.gif
    ```
2. Install all dependencies:
   ```cmd
   npm i
   ```
3. Deploy the app to your server:
   ```cmd
   rc-apps deploy --url <url> --username <username> --password <password>
   ```
4. Once deployed, we need to set the prefences to use all the features. Go to installed apps -> private apps and under settings provide the following settings:
   
   > a. apiKey: Replicate API Key, generate one from [here](https://replicate.com/).
   
   > b. webhookUrl: Can be easily found under the details panel, under the API heading. Copy the URL part and paste in this field.
